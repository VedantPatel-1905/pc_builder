                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Maybe it's a new game that has pushed beyond the graphical limits of current PC. Maybe you have a new high-resolution monitor you want to make the most of. Perhaps your competitiveness has increased or you might just want something new and shiny to look at - whatever the reason, we provide upgrading customers with access to exclusive discounts on all parts we can source as a reward for your ongoing loyalty to NZXT.</p>
                    <p>Combine this with the free labour cover you are entitled to under your Evolution Warranty cover, and it means you can upgrade more often without having to buy a complete new system every few years like most other PC and console gamers.</p>
                    <p>Contact our dedicated sales team who will help recommend some options for you on how best to invest that hard earned cash.</p>
                    <p>Your NZXT is a lifeforce that is born, not made, and it will grow with you over time.</p>
