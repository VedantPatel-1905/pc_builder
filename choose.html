                <h2>ASCENDA</h2>
                <p>ASCENDA is an entry level gaming PC with big performance</p>
                <p>Designed for those who are looking for their first gamer PC, to maybe transition from console, who want to play the latest games on high settings at 60FPS. The slightly higher initial cost is offset by not only gaining access to more games, but access to the best prices. There are tonnes of options for upgrades now and in the future, from increasing storage or memory, to upgrading key components like processors or graphics cards, options which are typically not available to consoles.</p>

                <h2>AGILIAN</h2>
                <p>If you're looking for something still affordable but with a bit more punch, AGILIAN could be the system for you.</p>
                <p>Featuring some noticeable style upgrades over its little brother, AGILIAN's primary focus is on price for performance. Foregoing some of the lavish extras typically found on more expensive systems, but nailing key performance factors like raw speed and grunt.</p>
                <p>Enjoy silky smooth graphics and play your favorite games at high and ultra settings at 60FPS and above.</p>

                <h2>OMNIA</h2>
                <p>As we start to creep up the performance ladder, more possibilities are unlocked. With OMNIA we're starting to encroach on online streaming and competitive gaming territory.</p>
                <p>With a higher premium comes more premium quality and more options, so OMNIA is designed for people who are looking to take all of the above and expand on it.</p>
                <p>With ever increasing performance and sleeker lines, this type of system starts to open things up to a more enthusiast level audience, adding more versatility with advanced features like overclocking, designed to help you squeeze even more out of your system.</p>

                <h2>GALLANTIS</h2>
                <p>GALLANTIS is similar in performance to OMNIA, but takes a wider stance on looks.</p>
                <p>Employing a more heavy duty chassis with further emphasis on lighting, GALLANTIS is an excellent balance for those wanting huge frame rates to play the latest games at ultra settings, and jealousy inducing aesthetics.</p>
                <p>Big on modern features, GALLANTIS is an excellent investment for those wanting a high performance system that turns heads, which they can expand upon and grow over the years.</p>
